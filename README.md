# HeartML
Machine Learning for Co-Prediction of Heart Disease and Diabetes. 

Heart disease (1st) and Diabetes (7th) are two of the most common causes of death in the United States [1]. Not only does co-incidence of the two disease often lead to medical complications and poor patient outcomes, but also contributes to drastically increased healthcare spending. Using only cardiovascular physiological parameters, we implement and evaluate several machine learning approaches to predict the whether a patient has diabetes and/or heart disease. We find that our KNN classifier achieves 80 percent accuracy, which exceeds both the baseline and physician oracles.
